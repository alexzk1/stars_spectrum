How to do get stars spectrum for $5 cheap.
Simples steps of how to get stars spectrums:
* Get transparent plastic for lazer printing (pics/paper_lomond) samples.
* Get a lazer printer with at least 600 dpi
* Generate desired grid using dif_generator.lua, 

usage: dif_generator.lua lines_per_mm dpi > grid.svg 

* Print that grid (pics/paper_printed)
* Make a mask for your telescope((pics/paper_usage)
* Have fun pics (pics/spectrum_aldebaran)

I spent $5 for this paper set only.
